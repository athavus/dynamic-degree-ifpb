# Dynamic Degrees
Dynamic Degrees is a web application that visualizes the connections between curricular components of IFPB's degree programs. It is implemented using JavaScript and the Depth-First Search algorithm. The application can be accessed at https://matrizdinamica-ifpb.netlify.app/course/1.

## Motivation
The aim of this project is to help students better understand the relationships between the different curricular components of their degree program. By visualizing these relationships, students can make more informed decisions about which courses to take, which prerequisites to fulfill, and which electives to choose.

## Features
- Dynamic visualization of the connections between curricular components
- User-friendly interface that is easy to use and understand
- Support for multiple degree programs
- Responsive design that works on desktop and mobile devices

## Implementation
The web application is implemented using JavaScript and the Depth-First Search algorithm. The curricular data is stored in a JSON file, which is loaded into the web application when it is launched. The web application then uses the Depth-First Search algorithm to traverse the graph and generate a visualization of the connections between the different curricular components.
